	<h2>Financial<br>Review</h2>
	<p>The Group’s financial results for 2014 reflect what has been a challenging period for the oil and gas sector with the significant decline in the oil prices and the resultant impact on both direct revenue and also the balance sheet values of assets. Given the nature of Petroceltic’s production portfolio which generates the majority of its revenue from gas production, the Group’s 2014 revenue has not been materially affected by the reduction in commodity prices. However, the current low price environment does impact on the asset value of the Group’s oil and gas assets, which has contributed to the significant impairment charges reflected in the 2014 results.<br><br><b>Tom Hickey</b><br>Chief Financial Officer</p>
