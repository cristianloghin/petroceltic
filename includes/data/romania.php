				<p>During 2014, Petroceltic operated two offshore exploration concessions in the Romanian sector of the Black Sea with a 40% operated interest in each. The licences, Block 27 Muridava and Block 28 Est Cobalcescu, are located in shallow water and have a combined area of approximately 2,000 sq km. Both blocks cover an area that has historically been under-explored due to a previous maritime border dispute.</p>
