				<p>Petroceltic has a 100% operated interest in three producing gas fields and one future development in the Galata Exploration Block, which is located in shallow water, offshore Bulgaria, in the Black Sea. The producing fields were developed using an unmanned platform located on the main Galata field, to which the Kaliakra and Kavarna fields have been tied-back using subsea completions.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The combined production rate from the Galata, Kaliakra and Kavarna fields averaged 18.6 MMscfpd during the year, with a cumulative production volume of 6.8 Bcf. The gas was sold to two customers, Bulgargaz (the state gas utility company) and Agropolychim (an independent fertiliser plant) at an average price of $8.34/Mcf giving total revenues of $51m.</p>
