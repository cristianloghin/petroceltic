				<p>The licence is located in the Gulf of Patra and covers an area of 1,892 sq km with water depths principally in the range of 100 to 300 metres. The concession is potentially oil prospective in the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Eocene formations and the regional hydrocarbon system has been proven by the Katakolon oil discovery wells drilled in 1982, approximately 35 kilometres south of the block. There are also several known oil seeps around the Gulf of Patra area.</p>

			<div>
				<p>There is extensive 2D seismic data already available over the block and the unrisked mean prospective resources for the mapped prospects lie in the range of 80 MMbbl to 360 MMbbl.</p>
				<p>The Group is currently considering divestment of this licence.</p>
