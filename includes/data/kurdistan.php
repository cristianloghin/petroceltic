				<p>Petroceltic has been active in the Kurdistan Region since 2011 when the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks were awarded with Petroceltic holding a 16% interest (20% paying interest) in each Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) in the northern area of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (“KRI”). The blocks were awarded in partnership with the operator, Hess Middle East New Ventures Ltd (“Hess”), with a 64% participating interest (80% paying interest) and the KRG with a 20% carried interest.</p>

				<p>The work programme for each block consisted of 2D seismic and the drilling of two exploration wells, one on each block. The Company’s first exploration well in the KRI, Shakrok-1, was spudded in August 2013 and reached a total depth of 3,538 metres in the Triassic Geli Khana formation in March 2014. Drill Stem Tests were carried out over four prospective zones in the Jurassic.</p>
