<p class="intro">Our strategy is to bring our development asset to first gas on schedule and to maximise the value of our producing assets through on-going investment, active reserves management and cost control. Through discovery of assets with material hydrocarbon resource potential, we develop these assets to deliver superior shareholder value. We focus on developing material asset positions in attractive fiscal regimes with strong partners that can add complementary skills as well as financial strength. Our geographical focus is Middle East-North Africa (“MENA”), the Black Sea and the Mediterranean basin.</p>
