	<h2>Chairman’s<br>Statement</h2>
	<p>I am pleased with Petroceltic’s production and development business which performed well in 2014. Production was in line with guidance and a series of contract awards in respect of the Ain Tsila development asset in Algeria confirm the encouraging progress of this project. During 2015, we are focussing strongly on delivering value from our core producing assets and de-emphasising certain exploration initiatives, while maintaining exposure to long term growth.<br><br><b>Robert Adair</b><br>Chairman</p>
