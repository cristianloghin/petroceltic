				<p>Petrocelticâ€™s core area of operations in Egypt is in the onshore Nile Delta where it holds a 100% operated interest in 12 producing fields in 14 development concessions in the El Mansoura and the South East El Mansoura concession areas. The field development operations are managed through a Joint Operating Company called Mansoura Petroleum Company jointly owned by Petroceltic and the Egyptian Government.</p>

			<div>
				<p>During 2013 and 2014, the Company has significantly renewed its exploration portfolio in Egypt and in January 2014 PSCs were signed for two new licences. These include a 75% interest in the onshore South Idku concession and a 50% interest in the exciting, deep water North Thekah block, which is thought to contain an extension of the prolific Levantine basin exploration play.</p>
